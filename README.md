# Flask

<h3> Deploying webapp using flask. </h3>

<h4> Why I did this? </h4>
<p> What i learnt is to model an algorithm and get the metrics. But I wanted to use this models further. </br> 
    So I came to know about making web app, so I started to learn flask and build API. </br>  
    Now to make it cooler I wanted a frontend and instead of coding for it, I found a library named Flasgger. </br>
    I wanted to play with remote servers so also deployed it on AWS.  </p>
